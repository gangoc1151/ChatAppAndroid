Overview of project: Tavern Chat app is a messaging mobile application for students or workers to have a great and secure conversation with each other. The application is connected to Firebase Database to store user’s information as well as message content. This app is not only for entertainments but also it is the greatest app to discuss and exchange knowledge between two people.

The application allows users to add friends with others by using the search function or QR barcode. Therefore, they can start to talk to each other and share PDF files or picture images.
